Whoa, [name]!

You just shared some personal info for access to the 'Exclusive Content':

- Your Name: [name]
- Your Phone Number: [phone]
- Your IP Address: [ip address] (Which we were able to get when you visited this site and submitted the form)

Did you realize you gave all that away just by filling out a form?

A Friendly Heads-Up:

- Think twice before sharing your personal information online, especially for small perks or extras.
- Be cautious when downloading files from sources you don't trust.
- Remember, if a website isn't secure, your data might end up in the hands of third-party actors.
- Don't blindly trust website developers or forms asking for personal details.

Stay smart, stay safe, and keep your info secure!
