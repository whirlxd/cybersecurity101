# Welcome to our CryptiCon Website!

Hey there! We are super excited to share with you the journey of building this website for crypticon , a project that has been nothing but late-night coding sessions, and a lot of caffeine. We've created this site to help you understand the basics of cyber security in a fun and engaging way.

## The Inspiration

First off, let's talk about the look and feel of the site. If you're a fan of the Matrix movies (who isn't?), you'll notice that our UI is heavily inspired by it. We wanted to capture that cool, hacker vibe with a modern twist. The green and black theme, the animations, and the overall aesthetic are all nods to the iconic film series.
Iv also added like bracket and text effect for each heading to make it feel way more complete

## The Tech Stack

For the tech stack, we chose Vite, React, and Tailwind CSS. Why? Because they're literally the easiest way to make such a complicated site! Vite makes the development process super fast, React is perfect for building and reusing components (thats why i did not choose plain html cuz id then have to use web components ), and to be fair writing plain css in 2024 is a bit of a pain. Also the favicon is a simple emoji of a detective cause it looks cool.

## The Challenges

Building CryptiCon wasn't all smooth sailing. One of the biggest challenges was making each page feel fresh and unique. We didn't want any two pages to look the same, so we had to get creative with our designs and layouts.

Another major hurdle was creating a page generation engine. We had a ton of content to include, and manually creating each page would have been a nightmare. So, we built an engine that could generate pages dynamically based on the content we fed it. It started out as a large code which i was eventually able to refactor into a few lines of code.

And let's not forget the content itself. Writing and curating all that information was a massive task. We wanted to make sure everything was accurate, engaging, and not very chatgpt like. It took a lot of research, writing, and editing to get everything just right.

## Favorite Features

Now, let's talk about some of my fav features that i made

- **Warnings with Sign-Ups and Downloads**: The best way to learn is by doing, so we wanted to make sure that users were aware of the risks involved in signing up for accounts or downloading files. Like downloading stuff from a fishy site i made sure to make them feel harassed for information and make them download a file forcefully ( pls do open it one )

- **Interactive Quiz**: Originally we wanted to make a quiz that would be a section before the exclusive content access but ayaan thought it would be better as it was locked behind the information reveal thing.

- **Responsive Design**: As previously mentioned we made sure to use a different design for all sections of the website and making each layout responsive was the hardest part prolly but we did it and we are proud of it.

- **Improving Metrics**: Something really common in peoples belief is that react is slow. But we made sure to optimize the website to the best of our abilities.After doing intensive research we came to the conclusion that it will take 17 seconds to load all the images without using lazy load , so we added a cool starting animation.

## Final Thoughts

Building this site was a challenging but incredibly rewarding experience. We learned a lot about cyber security, web development, and working as a team. We hope you enjoy using this as much as we enjoyed building it. If you have any feedback or suggestions, feel free to dm us about it
